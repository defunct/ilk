    Once you've got for assignability, you need acutalization. Once you have
    actualization, you might as well do variable assignment, since it won't do
    well to have that external. Thus, it is hard to make this a tiny library and
    the word "token" in super type token is misleading. Ilk will do a lot more.

    Ilk makes the downstream libraries smaller. Ilk Inject is thread-safe,
    constructor and setter dependency injection for under 90K. Ilk Assocation is
    a mere 1.8K to map object type, assignability or annotations to other
    objects, so think of handlers or filters based on type in your application
    framework.

    Reflection split out nicely, but try as I might, I couldn't get it down to
    the size of what I consider a "token", under 10K. Ilk is now hovering around
    18K. There is little that I can take away, but nothing to add. Using the
    variable substitution I'm able to derive any sort of type necessary.

    I was working to keep this small to keep Ilk Inject small. I tried to make
    this minimal, but now I'm adding a few bits and pieces to round it out.

    I believe the upper limit on this library for size is 20K.
