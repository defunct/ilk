A dependency injection utility class and supporting classes.
<p>
Having created a super type token and seeing some of what it could do, I created
a nice association class, a generic collection that mapped parameterized types
to an object or list of objects based on assignability. From there, creating a
dependency injector was short walk.
<p>
The motivations were that there was a lot about the existing dependency
injection frameworks that I didn't understand, and there was a lot that I didn't
use.
<p>
Much of what I saw was dependency injection as framework, how to build your
application for a container. What I wanted was dependency injection as utility.
I wanted to wield the sword of dependency injection and cut through
object graph initialization at the micro level as well as the macro level.
<p>
Dependency injection as framework seems to gear development toward offering
fancy features as the motivation for adoption of dependency injection. Notions
such as two classes being able to inject each other into their constructors. 
<p>
I find this sort of thing to be dishonest. The illusion of immutability is
tranparent for me and does not satisfy. I do not need the dependency injetion
framework to build object graphs that would be impossible to build without the
dependency injection framework.
<p>
For the most part, I wanted to get my hands on the injector and build something
with it, not look at it as a boundary, but as any other builder.
<p>
Which meant creating a library that was easy to use and documented for use from
both the injected and the injectee. Creating a library that was small and light
with an API that was small and light, so that it wouldn't be a burden to employ
dependency injection whereever an object graph needed to be wired up.
<p>
The most important aspects of a dependency injector are supported.
<p>
Ilk Inject is design for concurrent use, so that singleton objects can be shared
across threads. Object graphs that are shared through scopes are build entirely,
then added to the scopes, while other threads are made to wait if they are
attempting to obtain the objects being built.
<p>
Ilk Inject supports constructor injection and setter injection both duriong
construction, injecting any method or field annotated with <code>Inject</code>.
You can subsequently inject any public field or method on an object created by
the injector if you feel like injecting some more. This makes it easy to get all
frameworky in any corner of your code, build objects via the injector and call
their methods with the injector, so that you don't have to pass arguments, just
inject.
<p>
It provides custom scopes, but with only one implementation of a scope that
could be used in different ways to get the most common effects. It supports
child injectors with scopes that are local to the child injector, that disappear
when the child injector is collected.
<p>
Ilk Inject uses no proxies nor generates any byte code nor disables any
ecapsulation via reflection. It is all Java API Java.

FIXME Read this and make sure I don't sound too clever.
